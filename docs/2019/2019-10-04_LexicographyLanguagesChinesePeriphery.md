A book chapter recently came out: 

["The Chinese Periphery to c. 1800,"](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316827437.011) in *The Cambridge World History of Lexicography*, edited by John Considine, 202--22 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2019). 

It discusses the lexicographies of eastern Inner Asia, Japan, and Korea that were directly influenced by the Chinese tradition. The first section talks about lexicography in the Inner Asian empires in the early second millennium AD, with a focus on the lexicography of the Tangut and Mongols in North China. It then turns to the lexicography of Inner Asian languages in the Chinese Ming empire and then to the lexicography of Manchu and Mongolian in the Qing empire. The remaining two sections of the chapter deal with lexicography in Japan and Korea.
