I recently gave two presentations for the Taiwan Society for Inner Eurasian Studies 臺灣內陸歐亞學會. They can be viewed on the society's YouTube channel.

The first presentation is titled ["The Parisian Manchu movable type and its background" 巴黎的滿文活字字體及其背景](https://youtu.be/MW6VttC5Hao). It is based on chapter 8 of *The Early Modern Travels of Manchu: A Script and Its Study in East Asia and Europe*, but I forgot to mention that in the presentation. 

The second presentation is titled ["Marine animals in Kangxi's *Imperially Commissioned Mirror of the Manchu Language* and European sea monsters" 康熙《御製清文鑑》中的海洋動物與歐洲海怪](https://youtu.be/GK08uI0kLb0). This presentation is based on research for a book that I'm writing together with [He Bian](https://history.princeton.edu/people/he-bian).
