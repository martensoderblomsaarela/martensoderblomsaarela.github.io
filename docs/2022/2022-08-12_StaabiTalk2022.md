On August 4, 2022 I gave a talk at Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin on the topic of "Manchu philology at the Qianlong court." The talk can now be viewed on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/jiABdyFC6RQ). Unfortunately the questions asked during the Q&A are not very audible, and I failed to repeat them for the microphone.

The talk is based on two chapters from a book manuscript that Iâ€™m working on. More on that in a future post (hopefully).
