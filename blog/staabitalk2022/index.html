<meta property="og:description" content="On August 4, 2022 I gave a talk at Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin on the topic of &ldquo;Manchu philology at the Qianlong court.&rdquo; The talk can now be viewed on YouTube. Unfortunately the questions asked during the Q&amp;A are not very audible, and I failed to repeat them for the microphone.
The talk is based on two chapters from a book manuscript that I&rsquo;m working on. More on that in a future post (hopefully)." />
