        "body": "This ongoing research project was previously titled \u0026ldquo;A Cultural and Political History of Language in Qing China,\u0026rdquo; but (as of September 2020) I think that its focus on spoken Chinese in particular deserved to be highlighted in the title. In this project, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to figure out how a form of Mandarin Chinese based on the Beijing dialect came to be seen as the language of the government and of the political elite. Much research has been devoted to this topic from the late nineteenth century down through the twentieth. But Mandarin Chinese as a language of state has a longer history that has not been sufficiently investigated (a lot of great work notwithstanding).\nAn important hypothesis, if one can call it that, is that the official plurilingualism of the imperial government in the Qing empire encouraged the emergence of a clearly defined standard of spoken Chinese. Thus the presence of Manchus on the imperial throne benefited the formation of a Chinese national language.\nAnother of my assumptions is that the study of China\u0026rsquo;s languages by foreigners has a lot to tell us about the sociolinguistical situation within China itself. Foreigners often wanted to learn the languages that they thought were useful for gaining access to the Chinese elite and its culture. What they studied and how they went about doing it can tell us something about the linguistic practices and preferences of influential groups within China.\nThis page contains a brief summary of my work on the project so far.\nMy first paper to deal with this topic to some extent was \u0026ldquo;Alphabets avant la lettre: Phonographic Experiments in Late Imperial China\u0026rdquo;, which argued that the reform of the Chinese script in the direction of an alphabet did not start in the late nineteenth century, but has a longer history reaching back at least to the late Ming period.\nIn \u0026ldquo;Mandarin over Manchu: Court-Sponsored Qing Lexicography and Its Subversion in Korea and Japan\u0026rdquo; I looked at how books published by the Qing court for the promotion of Manchu were used in China\u0026rsquo;s periphery as sources for Mandarin Chinese. I think that the use of these books by foreign scholars suggests that the language politics of the Qing court might not have had the effect that was initially intended, and that some kind of northern form of Mandarin appeared interesting to outside observers already in the eighteenth century.\n\u0026ldquo;A Guide to Mandarin, in Manchu: On a Partial Translation of Guanhua zhinan (1882) and Its Historical Context\u0026rdquo; also looked at the study of Mandarin Chinese by foreigners, and at the links that such study still had to Manchu in the very last years of Qing rule. The paper situates a Japanese textbook for Mandarin in a longer history of plurilingual language pedagogy in Northeast Asia.\nThe paper \u0026ldquo;Joshua Marshman and the Study of Spoken Chinese\u0026rdquo; discussed another instance of the study of Mandarin Chinese by foreigners in the nineteenth century. Marshman, an English Baptist missionary in India, believed that only through a mastery of both Sanskrit and Mandarin could the Chinese language be really comprehended. Although Marshman\u0026rsquo;s hope to forge a hybrid, Sanskrit-infused Sinology appeared as a dead end in his time, he was right to focus on the importance of foreign contacts in the formation of the modern Chinese language.\nThe paper \u0026ldquo;Manchu, Mandarin, and the Politicization of Spoken Language in Qing China,\u0026rdquo; published in a book that I co-edited with Henning Klöter. The paper discusses the the coexistence of literary Chinese, written vernacular Chinese, Mandarin, and Manchu in the early and mid-Qing period, and the way in which the administration responded to plurilingualism within the government. The paper also argues that commercially published books of Manchu-Chinese language pedagogy evidence a growing concern for vernacular languages beyond the government in the period.\nMore work on this project is underway—I will update this page as it appears.\n"

        "body": "An article was just published:\n\u0026ldquo;Public Inscriptions and Manchu Language Reform in the Early Qianlong Reign (1740s\u0026ndash;60s),\u0026rdquo; Saksaha 16 (2019\u0026ndash;2020): 31\u0026ndash;53.\nAbstract\nOfficial signs and steles in the Qing empire were often at least bilingual, with Manchu and Chinese either side by side or on opposite sides. New institutions and renovated buildings necessitated new Manchu words and turns of phrase for the accompanying inscriptions. Under the Qianlong emperor, the text that should go on plaques and steles was carefully scrutinized, especially regarding the use of Manchu vocabulary. Public inscriptions thus involved watchful editing. The emperor was not the only driving force behind the reform. In part, individuals who moved through Beijing and Manchuria saw the words inscribed in the built-up environment around them change because officials in the field had memorialized the throne to draw attention to usages that the initial reform had missed. This paper will discuss this process.\n"

        "body": "The Early Modern Travels of Manchu: A Script and Its Study in East Asia and Europe (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2020) has been published. Right now (March 2020), at least, the promo code PP20 should give you a 20% discount when purchasing the book through the publisher\u0026rsquo;s website.\nHere is the description of the book from the University of Pennsylvania Press website:\n Manchu was a language first written down as part of the Qing state-building project in Northeast Asia in the early seventeenth century. After the Qing invasion of China in 1644, and for the next two and a half centuries, Manchu was the language of state in one of the early modern world\u0026rsquo;s great powers. Its prominence and novelty attracted the interest of not only Chinese literati but also foreign scholars. Yet scholars in Europe and Japan, and occasionally even within China itself, were compelled to study the language without access to a native speaker. Jesuit missionaries in Beijing sent Chinese books on Manchu to Europe, where scholars struggled to represent it in an alphabet compatible with Western pedagogy and printing technology. In southern China, meanwhile, an isolated phonologist with access to Jesuit books relied on expositions of the Roman alphabet to make sense of the Manchu script. When Chinese textbooks and dictionaries of Manchu eventually reached Japan, scholars there used their knowledge of Dutch to understand Manchu.\nIn The Early Modern Travels of Manchu, Mårten Söderblom Saarela focuses on outsiders both within and beyond the Qing empire who had little interaction with Manchu speakers but took an interest in the strange, new language of a rising world power. He shows how—through observation, inference, and reference to received ideas on language and writing—intellectuals in southern China, Russia, France, Chosŏn Korea, and Tokugawa Japan deciphered the Manchu script and explores the uses to which it was put for recording sounds and arranging words.\n "

The chapter compares this bilingual project to an unfinished Chinese–French dictionary inspired by the same source. It argues that at a time of linguistic and social change in China, Banihûn and Pu-gong aspired to further integrate the empire\u0026rsquo;s two literary languages and thereby to provide a resource for lettered bannermen such as themselves and to maintain what they knew to be the fragile linguistic equilibrium.\n"

The first section talks about lexicography in the Inner Asian empires in the early second millennium AD, with a focus on the lexicography of the Tangut and Mongols in North China. It then turns to the lexicography of Inner Asian languages in the Chinese Ming empire and then to the lexicography of Manchu and Mongolian in the Qing empire.
