        "body": "\u0026ldquo;Manchu Language,\u0026rdquo; Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Asian History March 25, 2021.\nAbstract:\n The Manchu language was the language of state in the Qing empire, which ruled China and large parts of Inner Asia from 1644 to 1911. For much of its history, it was used by communities in which Chinese was also spoken and written, but Manchu is a Tungusic language that is unrelated to Chinese. Its implementation in China and maintenance as the administrative language of core elements of the Qing imperial bureaucracy prompted the development of a Manchu education system and a tradition of bilingual Manchu-Chinese language pedagogy.\nLong before upwardly mobile individuals in China from the late 19th century onward committed to the study of the languages of the industrialized West and Japan, numerous Chinese-speaking servants of the Qing throne applied themselves to the study of Manchu. Over time, not only a voluminous government archive accrued in Manchu but also a literature in several genres that consisted largely of translations from Chinese.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, Manchu ceased to be a vernacular language in many areas where it had been previously spoken. It remained in use longest on parts of the imperial periphery, even beyond the fall of the Qing empire itself. Both as an administrative language and as a vernacular, Manchu survived into the tumultuous new century. Over time, however, it was supplanted by Chinese in most places. Yet dialects of Manchu remain spoken by small communities as of the early 21st century.\n "

It examines instances in which the choice of language rose to the level of discussion in two related genres of official documents that emerged in the eighteenth century: palace memorials and court letters. I argue here that the coexistence of the two written languages of Manchu and Chinese within the government, a fait accompli after 1644, posed a constant problem for official communications. Various attempts were made to solve this problem, with limited success. Toward the end of the article, to expand discussion to language use within the bureaucracy as a whole, I bring these genres to bear on the issue as it appeared in lateral communications.\n"

        "section": "blog",
        "date" : "2020.10.16",
        "body": "This ongoing research project was previously titled \u0026ldquo;A Cultural and Political History of Language in Qing China,\u0026rdquo; but (as of September 2020) I think that its focus on spoken Chinese in particular deserved to be highlighted in the title. In this project, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to figure out how a form of Mandarin Chinese based on the Beijing dialect came to be seen as the language of the government and of the political elite. Much research has been devoted to this topic from the late nineteenth century down through the twentieth. But Mandarin Chinese as a language of state has a longer history that has not been sufficiently investigated (a lot of great work notwithstanding).\nAn important hypothesis, if one can call it that, is that the official plurilingualism of the imperial government in the Qing empire encouraged the emergence of a clearly defined standard of spoken Chinese. Thus the presence of Manchus on the imperial throne benefited the formation of a Chinese national language.\nAnother of my assumptions is that the study of China\u0026rsquo;s languages by foreigners has a lot to tell us about the sociolinguistical situation within China itself. Foreigners often wanted to learn the languages that they thought were useful for gaining access to the Chinese elite and its culture. What they studied and how they went about doing it can tell us something about the linguistic practices and preferences of influential groups within China.\nThis page contains a brief summary of my work on the project so far.\nMy first paper to deal with this topic to some extent was \u0026ldquo;Alphabets avant la lettre: Phonographic Experiments in Late Imperial China\u0026rdquo;, which argued that the reform of the Chinese script in the direction of an alphabet did not start in the late nineteenth century, but has a longer history reaching back at least to the late Ming period.\nIn \u0026ldquo;Mandarin over Manchu: Court-Sponsored Qing Lexicography and Its Subversion in Korea and Japan\u0026rdquo; I looked at how books published by the Qing court for the promotion of Manchu were used in China\u0026rsquo;s periphery as sources for Mandarin Chinese. I think that the use of these books by foreign scholars suggests that the language politics of the Qing court might not have had the effect that was initially intended, and that some kind of northern form of Mandarin appeared interesting to outside observers already in the eighteenth century.\n\u0026ldquo;A Guide to Mandarin, in Manchu: On a Partial Translation of Guanhua zhinan (1882) and Its Historical Context\u0026rdquo; also looked at the study of Mandarin Chinese by foreigners, and at the links that such study still had to Manchu in the very last years of Qing rule. The paper situates a Japanese textbook for Mandarin in a longer history of plurilingual language pedagogy in Northeast Asia.\nThe paper \u0026ldquo;Joshua Marshman and the Study of Spoken Chinese\u0026rdquo; discussed another instance of the study of Mandarin Chinese by foreigners in the nineteenth century. Marshman, an English Baptist missionary in India, believed that only through a mastery of both Sanskrit and Mandarin could the Chinese language be really comprehended. Although Marshman\u0026rsquo;s hope to forge a hybrid, Sanskrit-infused Sinology appeared as a dead end in his time, he was right to focus on the importance of foreign contacts in the formation of the modern Chinese language.\nThe paper \u0026ldquo;Manchu, Mandarin, and the Politicization of Spoken Language in Qing China,\u0026rdquo; published in a book that I co-edited with Henning Klöter, discusses the coexistence of literary Chinese, written vernacular Chinese, Mandarin, and Manchu in the early and mid-Qing period, and the way in which the administration responded to plurilingualism within the government. The paper also argues that commercially published books of Manchu-Chinese language pedagogy evidence a growing concern for vernacular languages beyond the government in the period.\nMore work on this project is underway—I will update this page as it appears.\n"

New institutions and renovated buildings necessitated new Manchu words and turns of phrase for the accompanying inscriptions. Under the Qianlong emperor, the text that should go on plaques and steles was carefully scrutinized, especially regarding the use of Manchu vocabulary. Public inscriptions thus involved watchful editing. The emperor was not the only driving force behind the reform. In part, individuals who moved through Beijing and Manchuria saw the words inscribed in the built-up environment around them change because officials in the field had memorialized the throne to draw attention to usages that the initial reform had missed. This paper will discuss this process.\n"

Right now (March 2020), at least, the promo code PP20 should give you a 20% discount when purchasing the book through the publisher\u0026rsquo;s website.\nHere is the description of the book from the University of Pennsylvania Press website:\n Manchu was a language first written down as part of the Qing state-building project in Northeast Asia in the early seventeenth century. After the Qing invasion of China in 1644, and for the next two and a half centuries, Manchu was the language of state in one of the early modern world\u0026rsquo;s great powers. Its prominence and novelty attracted the interest of not only Chinese literati but also foreign scholars. Yet scholars in Europe and Japan, and occasionally even within China itself, were compelled to study the language without access to a native speaker. Jesuit missionaries in Beijing sent Chinese books on Manchu to Europe, where scholars struggled to represent it in an alphabet compatible with Western pedagogy and printing technology. In southern China, meanwhile, an isolated phonologist with access to Jesuit books relied on expositions of the Roman alphabet to make sense of the Manchu script. When Chinese textbooks and dictionaries of Manchu eventually reached Japan, scholars there used their knowledge of Dutch to understand Manchu.\nIn The Early Modern Travels of Manchu, Mårten Söderblom Saarela focuses on outsiders both within and beyond the Qing empire who had little interaction with Manchu speakers but took an interest in the strange, new language of a rising world power. He shows how—through observation, inference, and reference to received ideas on language and writing—intellectuals in southern China, Russia, France, Chosŏn Korea, and Tokugawa Japan deciphered the Manchu script and explores the uses to which it was put for recording sounds and arranging words.\n "

The chapter compares this bilingual project to an unfinished Chinese–French dictionary inspired by the same source. It argues that at a time of linguistic and social change in China, Banihûn and Pu-gong aspired to further integrate the empire\u0026rsquo;s two literary languages and thereby to provide a resource for lettered bannermen such as themselves and to maintain what they knew to be the fragile linguistic equilibrium.\n"
